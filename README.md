What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Computational time for different systems. Considerations are made for capabilities of a system and the time it takes to complete a task. Weighing the pros and cons of both.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

The demands of the finished product determined the required system type.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The largest road block was my house flooding near finals. Luckily both of my professors offered a week extension to complete them. Also accidentally submitted a hashtable twice. Trying to balance too many things at one time is often detrimental to the end results.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

A deeper understanding of what systems offer what benefits and performance advantages. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

At the moment it hasnt. The scope and scale of my personal projects are generally not limited by performance, and there are generally work arounds for using a system in a way that it wasnt directly intended before. Part of the beauty of programming is the freedom. I would however keep all of this in mind for future work projects.
